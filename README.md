# Bionic Reading
It's **not** my invention! The original link is [bionic-reading.com](https://bionic-reading.com/).

## Status
I already implemented my own interpretation in my [lib.js](https://github.com/kekse1/lib.js/),
and now I'm going to do it again for my [v4](https://github.com/kekse1/v4/). This time I will
also publish it here in this repository. But it stays /TODO/.

### Original version
It's there in my [lib.js repository](https://github.com/kekse1/lib.js/), the path there is
[utility/bionic.js](https://github.com/kekse1/lib.js/blob/git/lib.js/utility/bionic.js).
